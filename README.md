### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to create a simple and visually appealing profile page using HTML and CSS. Here are some of the major learnings:

Flexbox for Centering and Layout:
I utilized Flexbox to center the content both horizontally and vertically. This helped in achieving a responsive and well-aligned layout.


body {
background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
height: 100vh;
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
}
Styling with CSS:
I learned to apply styles to various elements, such as setting background colors, using border-radius to create circular images, and adding hover effects to list items.

.hero img {
width: 50%;
margin: auto;
border-radius: 100%;
}

ul li:hover {
background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
cursor: pointer;
}
Responsive Design:
By using the viewport meta tag and flexible units like percentages, I ensured that the profile page looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

Advanced CSS Techniques:

- Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Learning more about CSS animations to make the page more interactive and engaging.

JavaScript Integration:

- Adding interactivity with JavaScript, such as dynamically updating content or implementing dark mode.
- Utilizing JavaScript frameworks like React for more complex projects.

Accessibility:

- Ensuring that my web pages are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- Learning about ARIA roles and how to implement them properly.
